# Effect Size by Continent Visualization

This project provides a visualization of effect sizes by continent using a bar plot with error bars representing confidence intervals. The visualization is created using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a simple and effective way to visualize effect sizes across different continents. The visualization includes:
- A bar plot showing the effect sizes for each continent.
- Error bars that represent the confidence intervals for the effect sizes.

Continents Represented:
Asia: The bar for Asia shows an effect size of 23, indicating a relatively high effect compared to other continents.
Africa: Africa has the highest effect size at 28, suggesting significant impact or relevance in the context being analyzed.
America: The effect size for America is lower at 14, indicating a lesser impact compared to Asia and Africa.
Multiple Countries: This category has an effect size of 20, which is substantial but still lower than Africa.
